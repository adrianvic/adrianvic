**Hi, internet!**

I'm Adrian Victor, known on-line as tenkuma. I have a [blog](https://adrianvic.github.io/) in my website, go take a look!

Talking with those beeping machines is my passion. I mainly make Minecraft plugins for fun, however I like many other aspects of computing and electronics, like servers and self-hosting. I'm always into something different.
