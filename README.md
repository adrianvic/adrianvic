Hello, world!
I am Adrian Victor, currently 16 years old and learning a lot about programming. I'm a computing entusiast with focus on FOSS, information security and in building a strong foundation of programming knowledge to allow me have my own projects among a good portfolio.

## I'm...
- ...studying Computing at IFCC (Santa Catarina, Brazil)
- ...not focused in any big project.
- ...learning Java, Python and MySQL.
- ...learning music production.

## Plans
- I plan to learn Rust, C++, C, and Pascal;

## My inspirations
- @endermanch (Endermanch, YouTuber);
- Gabriel Pato (Ethical hacker);
- Jeff Geerling (YouTuber).
