**Hi, internet!**

I'm Adrian Victor, known on-line as tenkuma. I have a [blog](https://adrianvic.github.io/) on my website, go take a look!

Talking with those beeping machines is my passion. I mainly code Minecraft plugins for fun, however, I like many other aspects of computing and electronics, like servers and self-hosting. I'm always into something different.

_“Fantasy is not a crime, find your castle in the sky”_ - forgot to mention, I love music.
